#Scala in the Java EE world
Jan will show where, how and why we have used Scala to implement portions of typical Java EE applications. Discover what Scala promises to deliver and what the reality really is. Jan will discuss the journey Cake Solutions took over the last 2 years in using Scala in their Spring-based Java EE projects. Find out where Scala fits in your Java EE applications--from embedded DSLs, through the ordinary Java EE components implemented in Scala, through BDD-style testing approaches.   
Jan's talk will not show Scala in rose-tinted glasses; he will show the problems he and his team has encountered in adopting it, but he will also highlight the exceptional benefits you will gain from it.   
After the talk, you will have heard the "war stories" of adopting Scala in experienced Java EE team. You will then be able to decide whether Scala is right for you, your teams and your applications.   
##Audience
This is more of an overview talk, not getting into the intricate details of Scala syntax or features, but a [hopefully] well reasoned argument for Scala in your Java EE projects. This is suitable to everyone, even without any Scala/Spring/JEE experience.
